## Introduction

In the automotive industry, determining the fair market value of a used car is crucial for both sellers and buyers. This project employs machine learning algorithms to predict the price of used cars based on historical data. By leveraging regression techniques, the system can provide estimates that help users make informed decisions about pricing.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about various used cars, including their make, model, body, transmission and other relevant features. The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned to ensure optimal performance of the machine learning models.

## Methodology

The project employs a supervised learning approach to predict used car prices. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and various regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Gradient Boosting Regression are trained and evaluated. The model with the best performance metrics is selected for final predictions.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies .
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train the machine learning model.
4. Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict the prices of used cars by providing relevant input features.

## Results

The performance of the machine learning models is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE),  R-squared and adjacent R-square. The results indicate that the chosen model achieves accurate predictions with minimal error, making it suitable for practical applications.
